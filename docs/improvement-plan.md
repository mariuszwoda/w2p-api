# Calendar API Improvement Plan

## Current Status

The Calendar API is a Spring Boot application that provides endpoints for managing calendar events. It supports integration with Google Calendar and has authentication via Google and Facebook. The application is configured to use H2 for local development and PostgreSQL for production on Azure.

## Strengths

- Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive exception handling with a global exception handler
- Support for both soft and hard delete operations for calendar events
- Integration with Google Calendar
- Authentication via Google and Facebook
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and e2e tests using RestAssured
- Liquibase for database migrations with sample users
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, prod)

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Database Schema

- Add missing columns in Liquibase changelog for the `deleted` and `deleted_at` fields in the `calendar_events` table
- Add a user roles table for role-based access control
- Consider adding indexes for frequently queried fields

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement role-based access control for different API endpoints
- Add support for additional authentication providers as mentioned in the requirements
- Enhance security with rate limiting and IP-based restrictions

### 3. API Features

- Implement calendar sharing functionality
- Add support for recurring events with more complex patterns
- Implement notifications for upcoming events
- Add support for event categories/tags
- Implement search functionality for events

### 4. Integration

- Add support for Apple Calendar integration as mentioned in the requirements
- Implement synchronization with Microsoft Calendar
- Add webhook support for real-time updates

### 5. Performance and Scalability

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add pagination for endpoints that return large collections
- Optimize database queries for better performance
- Consider using async processing for non-critical operations

### 6. Documentation

- Enhance API documentation with more examples
- Add sequence diagrams for complex flows
- Create user guides for different authentication methods

### 7. Testing

- Increase test coverage for edge cases
- Add performance tests
- Implement contract tests for API consumers

### 8. DevOps

- Set up CI/CD pipeline for Azure deployment
- Implement infrastructure as code for Azure resources
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Implement automated database backups

### 9. Code Quality

- Update license to Apache License as per requirements
- Add more Java 17 features where applicable
- Enhance logging for better troubleshooting
- Consider using more design patterns for complex operations
