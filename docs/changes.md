# Changes Made to Fix Deprecated Code and Improve Code Quality

## 1. Fixed Deprecated Code

### GoogleCalendarServiceImpl.java

- Replaced deprecated `GoogleCredential` with `GoogleCredentials` from the Google Auth Library
- Updated the `getCalendarService` method to use the newer API
- Added the Google Auth Library dependency to pom.xml

## 2. Improved Exception Handling

### GoogleCalendarServiceImpl.java

- Replaced generic `catch (Exception e)` blocks with specific exception handling
- Added specific error messages for different types of exceptions:
  - `GeneralSecurityException` for security-related errors
  - `IOException` for I/O-related errors
  - `RuntimeException` for unexpected errors
- Improved logging with more descriptive error messages

## 3. Fixed Failing Tests

### W2pApiApplicationTests

- Added `@ActiveProfiles({"dev", "test"})` annotation to the test class to ensure it uses the correct profiles
- Created a test-specific `application-test.properties` file with the following configurations:
  - In-memory H2 database configuration
  - Disabled Liquibase for tests
  - Basic security settings
  - JWT configuration for tests

### E2E and Integration Tests

- Updated `CalendarEventE2ETest` to use both "dev" and "test" profiles by changing `@ActiveProfiles("dev")` to `@ActiveProfiles({"dev", "test"})`
- Updated `CalendarEventIntegrationTest` to use both "dev" and "test" profiles by changing `@ActiveProfiles("dev")` to `@ActiveProfiles({"dev", "test"})`
- This ensures that all tests use the same application context configuration

## 4. Test Results

- All controller tests pass successfully (19/19)
- The application context test now passes successfully
- All E2E tests pass successfully (3/3)
- All integration tests pass successfully (6/6)

## 5. Future Improvements

- Consider adding more specific exception types for better error handling
- Add more comprehensive logging for better debugging
- Consider implementing retry logic for transient errors
- Improve test configuration to be more robust across different environments
